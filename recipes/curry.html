        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="ingredient-list">
            <li>2 tablespoons coconut oil</li>
            <li>1(16 ounce) package skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into small cubes</li>
            <li>1(14 ounce) can cream of coconut</li>
            <li>1(11 ounce) bottle red Thai curry sauce</li>
            <li id="noodle">1/2 (16 ounce) package dried rice stick vermicelli noodles</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol class="direction-list">
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet on high heat. Add chicken cubes; cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Reduce heat to medium-high and add coconut cream and curry sauce. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in vermicelli pasta and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Reduce skillet heat to simmer. Add the noodles and let simmer until flavors are absorbed, about 5 minutes. Divide chicken and noodles among individual serving bowls.</li>
        </ol>
